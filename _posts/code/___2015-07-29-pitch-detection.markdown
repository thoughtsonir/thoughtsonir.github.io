In this post, I would like to introduce the Scattering transform and give a simple example of its use for music, more specifically, to get the fundamental frequency of note. Of course this is just a simple example to get started.


{% highlight C %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

Check out the [data group][datagroup] web page for more info on how the scattering transform, more code and new applications. Send me an email if you have any problem with this code to: sira.ferradans@ens.fr
