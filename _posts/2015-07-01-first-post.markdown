Welcome to out new blog. We are a group of researchers at the ENS in Paris, interested in data science.  The idea of this blog is to share ideas, code and general thoughts on any topic related to data analysis, with special emphasis on music analysis, computer vision, information retrieval, or just, generally, on the application of math in technology. We will also be posting code related to the projects we are working on, as links to papers that we find specially interesting. This will give an idea of what is going on in our area of expertise. 

Feel free to send any recommendations, comments, or also code to be posted to any of the authors.
